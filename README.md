1314-BeagleBone-Quadcopter
==========================

Create an inexpensive open-source project for a BeagleBone cape quadcopter. As of the beginning of April, 2014, we have flight! Some videos of the initial flight testing are located [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0pfk43b3zq14rjh/xk6Kl6lccb#/). Since then, the quadcopter has gotten easier to fly and more stable.

## Project Use ##
All of the quadcopter side code is located in I2C Bitbang. 
Control algorithm specific code is [here](https://github.com/Rose-Hulman-ROBO4xx/1314-BeagleBone-Quadcopter/tree/master_rev2/code/i2c_bitbang/pru_sw/example_apps/control_alg).

Note: the master_rev2 branch is the current development branch.
