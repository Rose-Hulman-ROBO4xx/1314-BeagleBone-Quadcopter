1314-BeagleBone-Quadcopter
==========================

Create an inexpensive open-source project for a BeagleBone cape quadcopter. As of the beginning of April, 2014, we have flight! Some videos of the initial flight testing are located [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0pfk43b3zq14rjh/xk6Kl6lccb#/). Since then, the quadcopter has gotten easier to fly and more stable.
